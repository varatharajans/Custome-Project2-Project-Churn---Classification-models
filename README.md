# Custome-Project2-Project-Churn---Classification-models
DATA ANALYTICS WITH R, EXCEL AND TABLEAU- Custom project 2 - Project Churn

Project B 5


1.	Classification Model : RV = churn
2.	Predictors: You need to decide, Good Predictors = say 25#; [1 variable = categorical= gender with 2 levels, 0= male, 1= female, 2nd = income = continuous, 3rd = age = continuous; Ho: mean income/age across gender are same; Independent Sample T Test/ANOVA; p <= 0.05]
3.	Five six models
4.	Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Pruning, Bagging, Random Forests, Adaptive Boosting, SVM, ANN, Nearest Neighbor…etc 
5.	Offer the best then
Guidelines
6.	Classification Accuracy, ROC Curves, AUC 
7.	Ten Ppts …1st Topic, Last = Thank You, wrap up in 8 slides….first 2, 3 should be about Exploratory Analysis….Categorical = Bar chart/Pie Chart, continuous = Histogram, Box plot, Correlation matrix, scatter plot…..heat map,  GGally
8.	R Script
9.	R Markdown
10.	Your website [refer ppt] https://tsrajan29.wixsite.com/data-analytics
